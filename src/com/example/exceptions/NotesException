//1. Exception Hierarchy :
//    ---> Throwable <-----
           //(checked)
   //--->Exception        Error
//     (checked)        (unchecked)
//|
//|
//RunTimeException
 //       (unchecked)

//There are three categories of exceptions
1/ Checked exceptions
2. Unchecked Exception / Runtime exceptions -- we can use interchangeably
3. Errors

1/ Checked Exceptions :  ( Situational error )
a. Java compiler requires us to handle
b. either we can declaratively throw the exceptions up the call stack or handle ourselves
c. Oracle documentation tells us to use checked exceptions when we can expect the caller of our program to be able to recover
d. Ex: IOExceptions and ServletExceptions

2. Unchecked exceptions : ( usage error )
a. Java compiler doesnot require us to handle
b. Simply put we create an exception that extends RunTime Exception then it will be unchecked exception
ex: NullPointerException , IllegalArgumentException and SecurityException

3. Error :
a. Represent serious and usually irrecoverable conditions like library incompatibility , memory leaks , infinite recursion
b. even though they dont extend runtime exception but they are unchecked exceptions
ex: stackoverflowerror and outofmemoryerror

4. Handling Exceptions :

4.1 throws :
a. simplest way to handle exception is rethrow it
b. simplest way to satisfy a compiler
c. it does mean that anyone that calls our method need to handle it

4.2 try-catch :
a. if we want to handle exception by ourselves then we can use try-catch block.
b. We can handle it by rethrowing our exception or by performing recovery steps

4.3 finally :
a. when we have code that need to be executed regardless of exeception occurs  then finally is used
b. we current example whether we need file or not we have to make sure to do appropriate cleanup

4.4 try with resources :
Example :



4.5 Multiple catch Blocks :
a. sometimes we can have multiple exceptions and can have more than one catch block handle each exception individually
b. Java lets us handle subclasses exceptions seperately : Place them higher in list of catches

4.6 Union Catch blocks :
a. if we know that the way to handle exceptions is same then Java 7 introduced the ability to catch multiple exception in same block


5. Throwing Exceptions :
a. throw keyword - when we dont want to handle exception ourselves or we want to generate our exceptions for others to handle
